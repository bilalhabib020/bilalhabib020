  💻 Front-End Developer | 🎯 Performance-Driven | 🌍 Open to Remote Work
</p> 

I'm a self-taught Front-End Developer with a background in electrical engineering and a strong passion for building responsive, user-friendly web applications. I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my craft.

I’ve built and deployed several projects using **React**, integrated third-party APIs, and worked with **Firebase**, **Redux**, **Bootstrap**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I’m currently focused on mastering **performance optimization** and bringing smooth, scalable UI experiences to life.
